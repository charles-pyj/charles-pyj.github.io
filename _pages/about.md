Hi there! I am Yijun Pan, a senior undergraduate student at University of Michigan, majoring in Data Science. I am also dual majoring in Electrical and Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During my undergrad years in both institutions, I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qiaozhu Mei](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/qiaozhu-mei), Prof. [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/), Prof. [Jiaqi Ma](https://jiaqima.github.io/about/) and Prof. [Jie Liu](https://jieliu6.github.io/).

My research interest lies in trustworthy AI and its application to scientific discovery, with an emphasis on Large Language Models.
